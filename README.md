[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DannyDainton/postman-travisci-example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DannyDainton/postman-travisci-example)

A very simple project to demonstrate using `Newman` to run a Postman collection through TravisCI.

The collection and environment files have been taken from the [All-Things-Postman Repo](https://github.com/DannyDainton/All-Things-Postman).
